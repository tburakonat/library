# library

This is my first Object Oriented Project. Every book is an instance of the Book class.

You can add new books to your library. You have to provide a title, the author, the number of pages and whether or not you have read it.

You can toggle the read status with a button and you can remove books from your library.

Every change is saved in localstorage.
